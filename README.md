# shivaUNIX data reduction
This repository contains all data reduction scripts and functions for the experiments performed on SHIVA rotary apparatus (National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology).
The data reduction scripts were written by @elena-esse E. Spagnuolo in 2010, with later contributions from @chrisharb C. Harbord and @aretu S. Aretusini.
The data reduction routine is retro-compatible with all experiments in SHIVA rotary apparatus.
